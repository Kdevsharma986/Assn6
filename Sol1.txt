Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves creating simplified models or representations of complex real-world entities. It allows programmers to focus on the essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction provides a way to create abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of common methods without implementing them, leaving the implementation details to the concrete subclasses.

Abstraction helps in managing complexity, making code more modular, reusable, and maintainable. It allows us to create high-level, generalized classes that can be extended and specialized by subclasses.
